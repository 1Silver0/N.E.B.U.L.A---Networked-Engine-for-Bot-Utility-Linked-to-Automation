This is a small Python project I’m building to practice real-world programming and because I’ve always thought Discord bots were "cool". 

**Current focus:**
Input → processing → output
Persistent storage with SQLite
Clean embed output

**I’m sharing this to get feedback and improve.**

## How to run N.E.B.U.L.A.:
**1. Install dependencies:**
pip install -r requirements.txt
**2. Set up bot token:**
Open 'NebulaV1.2_Main.py'
Find the line that looks like TOKEN = "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN" and replace "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN" with your actual Discord bot token
**3. Run the bot:**
Start the bot by running python NebulaV1.2_Main.py
**4. Database files:**
Make sure the .db and .json files in the database/ folder are present
**5. Enjoy! Invite your bot to a Discord server and test the commands.**
